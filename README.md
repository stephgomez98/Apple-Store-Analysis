# Cleaning Data
- Setting proper naming conventions:

The dataset originally used Pascal Snake Case naming conventions for each column. I decided to switch to Snake Case naming conventions for enhanced readability. Snake_case not only improves readability but also makes easier to identify when claues and functions are used.
````sql
EXEC sp_rename 'data.App_Name', 'app_name', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Primary_Genre', 'genre', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Content_Rating', 'content_rating', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Size_Bytes', 'size_bytes', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Required_IOS_Version', 'required_ios_version', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Released', 'released_date', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Updated', 'updated_date', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Version', 'version', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Price', 'price', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Currency', 'currency', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Free', 'free', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.DeveloperId', 'developer_id', 'COLUMN';

- Setting proper data type and size:
I've enchanced the integrity of the dataset by correcting the datatypes, making sure that data types the CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT, and being applied to only textual information. This practice also helps prevent potentional erros when attempting arithmetic operations on data meant for text. In these alter queries I also changed the size of the columns to optimize data storage and increase the speed of data retrievel and query performance since smaller column sizes result in faster data access and processing. This change allows for less memory to be taken up as well.


````sql
ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [size_bytes] BIGINT;

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [app_name] VARCHAR(350);

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [genre] CHAR(25);

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [required_ios_version] VARCHAR(10);

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [version] VARCHAR(100);

- Removing duplicates for app name:
````sql
WITH CTE AS

	released_date, updated_date, version, price, currency, free, developer_id, 
	developer_name, average_user_rating, number_of_reviews,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY app_name ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS RowNum
FROM [dbo].[data]
)
DELETE FROM CTE
WHERE RowNum>1;

# Variability Analysis 
Variability analysis is crucial for understanding the spread and dispersion of data in your dataset. 

- Variability: varince, standard deviation, max, and min

Standard Deviation of User Ratings by Genre:

This query calculates the standard deviation of user ratings for different app genres. High standard deviations indicate a wide range of user ratings, which may suggest more variability in user preferences within that genre. Understanding this variability can help developers target specific genres with more or less rating consistency.
````sql
SELECT genre, AVG(average_user_rating) AS avg_user_rating, STDEV(average_user_rating) AS rating_std_dev
FROM data
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY rating_std_dev DESC;
````
Price Variability by Genre:

This query explores the variability in app prices within different genres. It calculates the standard deviation of prices for each genre, helping developers identify genres with varying pricing strategies and user expectations. High price standard deviations may indicate a wide range of prices in a genre.
````sql
SELECT genre, MAX(price) AS max_price, MIN(price) AS min_price, STDEV(price) AS price_std_dev
FROM data
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY price_std_dev DESC;
````
Variability in Number of Reviews by Genre:

This query assesses the variability in the number of reviews within different app genres. High standard deviations in review counts may signify variability in user engagement and the competitive nature of the genre.
````sql

FROM data
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY reviews_std_dev DESC;
````
Release Date Variability by Genre:

Analyzing the variability in release dates within genres helps developers understand how genres evolve over time. High standard deviations in release dates may indicate dynamically changing genres or inconsistent app updates.

````sql
SELECT genre, MAX(released_date) AS latest_release, MIN(released_date) AS earliest_release, STDEV(released_date) AS release_date_std_dev
FROM data
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY release_date_std_dev DESC;
````
Version Update Frequency by Genre:

This query explores the variability in app update frequency (measured in days between updates) within genres. High standard deviations in update frequencies may indicate irregular update patterns, which can be important for competitive analysis and user satisfaction.

````sql
SELECT genre, AVG(updated_date - released_date) AS avg_days_between_updates, STDEV(updated_date - released_date) AS update_freq_std_dev
FROM data
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY update_freq_std_dev DESC;
````
Content Rating Variability by Genre:

This query calculates the standard deviation of user ratings within each genre and content rating combination. It helps identify genres and content ratings with varying user preferences, which can be important for building apps that align with audience expectations.

````sql
SELECT genre, content_rating, COUNT(*) AS app_count, STDEV(average_user_rating) AS rating_std_dev
FROM data
GROUP BY genre, content_rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY genre, rating_std_dev DESC;

# Explore Categorical Data

Exploring categorical data in data analysis is a fundamental practice because it unveils critical insights within datasets.It aids in tailored decision-making, such as choosing the right type of app to build, aligning content with age-appropriate ratings, and determining pricing strategies. Additionally, it ensures user satisfaction and app quality by analyzing user ratings, reviews, and engagement. Categorical data exploration also helps developers stay up-to-date with market trends, identify successful peers, explore collaboration opportunities, and maintain compliance with content guidelines. In summary, exploring categorical data is essential for data analysis as it equips developers with the insights needed to create user-focused, successful apps and adapt to the ever-changing app market.

Explore App Genres: 

This query helps app developers identify popular and in-demand app genres. Knowing which genres have a higher number of apps can inform developers about potential opportunities in those genres and help them make informed decisions about the type of app to build.

FROM [dbo].[data]
GROUP BY developer_name
ORDER BY app_count DESC;
````
App Version Trends: 

Analyzing app version trends by genre helps developers understand the update frequency and track the latest versions. Frequent updates may signify an active developer and a responsive app, important for maintaining user engagement.
````sql
SELECT genre, MAX(version) AS latest_version, MIN(released_date) AS first_release_date
FROM [dbo].[data]
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY genre;
````
App Lifecycle: 

Examining the app lifecycle by genre and the average time between updates provides insights into how long apps remain relevant in specific genres. Developers can identify trends and tailor their update strategies.
````sql
SELECT genre, DATEDIFF(day, MIN(released_date), MAX(updated_date)) AS average_days_between_updates
FROM [dbo].[data]
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY genre;
