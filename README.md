# Apple-Store-Analysis ðŸ“±
An app developer needs data driven insights to decide what type of app to build.
# Context
In this project the app developers are identified as the stakeholders. App developers often rely on data-driven insights to determine what type of app to build, understanding user preferences, market trends, and the competitive landscape.For a recent project aimed at aiding this decision-making process, I leveraged a valuable resource: an extensive app store dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset, accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/apple-appstore-apps. 
# Objective
By analyzing and drawing insights from this comprehensive dataset, I aimed to help app developers make data-informed choices when deciding on the type of app to develop. This involved assessing market demands, identifying successful genres, understanding user preferences, and considering competitive factors. The dataset from Kaggle served as a foundational resource, facilitating a data-centric approach to app development and enabling developers to create apps that resonate with their target audience. The project's results and insights will contribute to the app development community, , offering valuable information for strategizing, planning, and ultimately creating successful and impactful mobile applications

# Cleaning Data
- Setting proper naming conventions:

The dataset originally used Pascal Snake Case naming conventions for each column, but I decided to switch to Snake Case naming conventions for enhanced readability. Snake_case not only improves readability but also makes it more straightforward to identify and understand the operations applied to the data.
````sql
EXEC sp_rename 'data.App_Name', 'app_name', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Primary_Genre', 'genre', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Content_Rating', 'content_rating', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Size_Bytes', 'size_bytes', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Required_IOS_Version', 'required_ios_version', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Released', 'released_date', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Updated', 'updated_date', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Version', 'version', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Price', 'price', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Currency', 'currency', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Free', 'free', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.DeveloperId', 'developer_id', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Developer', 'developer_name', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Average_User_Rating', 'average_user_rating', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'data.Number_of_Reviews', 'number_of_reviews', 'COLUMN';

- Setting proper data type and size:
  
I've made a significant enhancement to the dataset by aligning columns with the proper data types.For instance, I've ensured that text-based data types like CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT, designed for storing textual information, are employed solely for their intended purpose. This measure helps prevent potential errors stemming from attempting arithmetic operations on data primarily meant for text, a practice that can lead to inaccuracies.Furthermore, I've optimized data storage by employing data types and sizes that are a precise fit for the information they represent. By avoiding overly large data types, we mitigate the risk of squandering storage space, particularly vital in the context of expansive databases. Moreover, this meticulous attention to the appropriate sizes contributes to the overall efficiency of data retrieval and query performance. Smaller data types not only process faster but also demand less memory resources, resulting in expedited and more resource-efficient data operations.
````sql
ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [size_bytes] BIGINT;

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [app_name] VARCHAR(350);

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [genre] CHAR(25);

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [required_ios_version] VARCHAR(10);

ALTER TABLE data
ALTER COLUMN [version] VARCHAR(100);

	released_date, updated_date, version, price, currency, free, developer_id, 
	developer_name, average_user_rating, number_of_reviews,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY app_name ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS RowNum
FROM [dbo].[data]
)
DELETE FROM CTE
WHERE RowNum>1;
````
- Removing rows containing null values:
````sql

	[content_rating] IS NULL OR
	[size_bytes] IS NULL OR

	[developer_name] IS NULL OR 
	[average_user_rating] IS NULL OR 
	[number_of_reviews] IS NULL OR
	[content_rating] IS NULL ;

		  [price] ='' OR
		  [average_user_rating] ='' OR
		  [number_of_reviews] ='' OR
		  [currency] ='' OR
		  [developer_id] ='' OR
		  [developer_name] ='' OR
		  [app_name] ='';

- Changing price and average user rating to round to second decimal:
````sql
	UPDATE data
	SET Price = ROUND(Price, 2),
	average_user_rating = ROUND(average_user_rating, 2);

# Descriptive Statitics 
Descriptive statistics are used to summarize, simplify, and understand datasets. They provide a quick overview of data's central tendencies, spread, and distribution, helping analysts identify patterns, trends, and outliers. Descriptive statistics aid in data cleaning, comparison, quality assurance, and decision-making. They also serve as a foundation for data visualization and effective communication of results, making complex data more accessible and actionable.
- Central tendency: mean, median, mode
````sql
mean
SELECT AVG(column_name) AS mean
FROM table_name;

median

# Explore Categorical Data
